# Clustering-Vault


## Overview
This repository is dedicated to clustering projects implemented using Python. It serves as a collection of various clustering techniques, including **Hierarchical Clustering**, **K-Means**, and **DBSCAN**. The projects will demonstrate data preprocessing, feature extraction, model implementation, and visualization.

## Projects
Currently, this repository is a work in progress, and projects will be added soon. Stay tuned for implementations on:

- **Movie Genre Clustering** ðŸŽ¬
- **Customer Segmentation for Retail Stores** ðŸ›’
- **News Article Clustering** ðŸ“°

Each project will include a step-by-step explanation, dataset details, and code implementation.

## Requirements
Once projects are added, they will require certain dependencies. You can install the essential ones using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn scipy matplotlib seaborn nltk wordcloud
```
Additionally, necessary NLTK datasets can be downloaded using:
```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('wordnet')
```

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/clustering-projects.git
cd clustering-projects
```
2. Explore the projects as they are added!
